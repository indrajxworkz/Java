1. 
	i)	 JDK stands for Java Development kit this consists of javac the compiler and all the neccesary development tool required for
			the developing the java program application
	ii)  JRE stands for Java Runtime environment which runs the code 
	iii) JVM stands for Java Virtual Machine which is invoked by the javacompiler which perfoms the compliation process 


2.	The Operations performed by Java Virtual Machine (JVM) are 
		i   check the bytecode stream line by line
		ii  interpert the code
		iii compile the code
		
3.  Java is platform independent because it the code can be constructed in any of the platform and also becasue of JDK .

4.  Its a non Primitive datatype the will provide a way to write program

5.  keywords are those which are predefined by java which makes the compilation easy examples : static, void   etc...

6.  a Variable that holds the datatype.

7.  Local Variables are those which are only dlcared under the main method and can be used in that particular program. 

8.  Variables that are declared outside the main methods these are also called as static variable  
		example : class Test {
					static String personName = "Indraj";
					public static void main(Strings [] args){
					String personContact = "9901xxxxxx";
					System.out.println(" The name of the person is : " + personName);
					System.out.println(" the Contact number is : " + personContact);
					}
				  }
9.  datatype are those which defines the type of data which is to be stored in the given variable examples int, double, String, boolean etc.... 

10. Main method it is the entry point for the exceution of the program. 

11. class EvenorOdd{
	 public static void main()
		int number = 50
		if(number%2==0){
		System.out.println(" The given is Even: " + number);
			}
		else 
		System.out.println(" The given is ODD: " + number);

}
